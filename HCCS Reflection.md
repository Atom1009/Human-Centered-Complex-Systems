# Human Centered Complex Systems Reflection - Pinak Limaye

## Week 1
**What I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about what a complex adaptive system is and real world examples of them. I also learnt about the differences between complex systems and other systems. Furthermore I learnt about emergence and the different system boundaries.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
Everything I learnt this week was mostly new to me. A few things such as what a system is was old information for me. This is because I have done a physics course in the past, which taught me about different systems and how we should go about defining a system for experiments. Other than that, I didn't know about what complex systems were and about the concept of emergence.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have mainly gained insights into complex systems, although the concept is still fairly confusing to me. It was initial incredibly different for me to understand complex systems because I was stuck in the idea of treating systems as a function in a program where you put in an input and get an output. And that the output or input couldn't come from within the system itself. I have now realised that a complex system can be impacted by anything within its own boundary and that thinking about complex systems in such a rigid manner does not work.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I realised that I have a very rigid way of thinking, which is a weakness in the case of this subject. However I have noticed that the strength of this subject is that it would help with modeling and dealing with scenarios which have many uncertain events.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I struggled alot with the discussion questions. Namely the one where I had to define the boundary and elements of the system. I was convinced that anything that affects the system was an input and not part of the system. But I handled it by getting a second opinion and doing some research by looking at different complex systems. I also looked at what other people were submitting as their answers.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I feel like dealt with the challenge fairly well. However next time I won't be so rigid in my way of thinking. That will make things much easier in the long run for this subject, as many things are wrought with uncertainty. So treating things as heavily defined won't work too well.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
The theory of complex systems is quite useful because it helps model uncertain scenarios so that you can predict possible outcomes. Because of this theory I have learnt how to model complex systems, but also the specific parts to look for in a system. The latter will probably be incredibly useful in my data analytics subject.



## Week 2
**What I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about creating models of complex systems and the idea of many models. I also learnt about the wisdom hierarchy

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
The new thing I learnt this week was the many models theory. Creating models was something I learnt in data analytics and the wisdom hierarchy was something I learnt in the information systems course. However many model thinking is new. Even though I have learnt about using many data points to reduce error, I did not think about applying that knowledge to the idea of models.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insight into the many model theory. And also insights into my programming projects because I am currently looking into machine learning. I have realised that using many different concepts and using them together to help train an AI is very useful. The idea of many models made me look back at one of my previous projects where I decided to use an algorithm out of the place it was usually used. And now I realise that doing that more will lead to newer more creative solutions.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I have observed the strength of using many models to help reduce errors and come up with a new solution. Especially in programming where using different algorithms or theories can lead to new and even better solutions.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I did not have any difficult challenges this week. This is because the things we learnt this week were fairly well defined by mathematic and modelling ideologies. So I did not have to deal with misunderstandings or confusion. However one thing I did struggle a bit with was defining the system and elements in the lessons activity. However this is a carry on problem from last week, so I did the same thing as last week and compared the scenario to other scenario with a created system model and mapped it over to the new scenario.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I will look at more complex systems so that I can be better at identifying elements and relationships.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
The many model theory proved to be very useful because it helps in reducing error. It also helps with my data analytics course which requires me to build a model to predict things from chaotic data. And I feel like this theory will be incredibly useful in helping with that. I have learnt that using many models is useful in accuracy.



## Week 3
**What I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about different behavioural models, signalling and decision trees. I also learnt about the Shapley value and the Last on the Bus model.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I now know about the shapley value, signalling and the three behavioural models (rational, behavioural, rule-based). I already knew about decision trees as I had learnt about it in data analytics. I learnt about the Last on the Bus model too, but I don't really see why I would use that model over the shapley value.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the different ways a person can think, i.e. rational, behavioural and rule-based. Knowledge of these models helps analyze different social situations or just simple decision making. I also realised that different people can be more on the rational side or on the behavioural side which makes these models about as useful as each other. Rule-based model seems the most useful to me because everyone follows a general set of rules when it comes to decision making. Things like how to act in public or treat other people is far more easily modeled by a rule-based model than it is by the other two. I have also gained insight into the shapely value and how it is used. Also the multiple examples helped me to see how I would go about fitting other scenarios into a shapley value.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I have realised the subject's strength when it comes to my data analytics course. Because things like decision trees, the shapely value and the idea of systems fits really well with my data analytics subjects. It has also been useful in making me think about my previous projects in new ways. Most notably it has made me think about my neural network again. Because I was wondering how I should distribute the error in a prediction as change accros the weights, the shapley value seems perfect for that.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding this weeks models. The only thing I am a bit confused about is how I would use Last on the Bus or signalling models.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am not sure how to improve upon my troubles this week because my troubles stem from me not fully understanding where I would use something. I think that I will eventually come across a situation where it is useful as long as I keep doing things.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Shapley value proved to be very useful because it helps out with neural networks. Although I haven't placed it in a neural network yet, it seems very useful in it. I have learnt that the Shapley value is a very useful model and that it could potentially be used in neural nets.



## Week 4
**What I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about the System Dynamic Models, Network Models and Agent Based Models.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I didn't know about any of the models before. However System Dynamic Models are similar to Finite State Machines which I learned about in programming.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the different models I learnt this week. Network models are useful in figuring out the potential impact of an idea or habits. Agent based models look great for figuring out how people may react. Agent based models remind me of Conways Game of Life. This game is on a grid and each square follows 3 simple rules. Each square is impacted by the 9 squares around it, if too many squares around the square are lit up, the square turns off. If too few squares are lit up, the square turns off. But, if enough squares are lit up around an off square, the off square turns on. The interesting thing with this game is that you can have many complex behaviours from these simple rules. So a couple of simple rules can be used to simulate complex behaviour which is Agent Based Models.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I think that I am fairly good at making random connections between ideas. Like with connecting conways game of life to Agent Based Models or with some projects that I have done in the past. Half the time it probably isn't a proper connection, but you miss all the shots you don't take so I consider it a strength.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding this weeks models. Agent based models are interesting though and I'm interested in the way that you would come up with the rules that an Agent Based Model uses.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am interested in Agent Based Models now and will look into it. This will help me in my understanding of Agent Based Models and help me in analysing them and making rules for them in the future.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Agent Based Models seem incredibly useful. Because if you can figure out the core set of rules that people run on, you can make a very complex simulation without using too much computational power and make it very simple to understand. This isn't learning something new, but, Agent Based Models help to solidify the idea that complex things can be made from very simple components.



## Week 5
**What I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about aggregation of action and different probability distributions. Namely the normal distribution and the log normal distribution. There was also a little bit of discussion into finite state machines.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I have learned both finite state machines and the normal distribution before in my maths and programming subjects in college. But the log normal distribution is new to me.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have mainly gained insights in to the log normal distribution and where it can be applied. I have also gained an additional insight into the network model that was discussed last week, as this distribution is often the effect of the outcome of those types of models. I have also gained additional insights into the world as a whole. Because everything seems to be connected to a logarithmic relationship in some way, either that or an exponential relationship (which is also related to log). Information theory has a logarithmic relationship, pace of life has a logarithmic relationship and so does entropy in physics and also the notes in music. I think that this is because things tend to change in an exponential manner due to things often leading to other things, causing a snowball effect. Even human perception seems to be exponential. We can easily tell if something is twice as loud as something else, but not if we add several decibals. And even stuff like the golden spiral which is found often in nature follows a logarithmic pattern.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
This subject is making me look at the world in new ways and writing these reflections always makes me blow my own mind by trying to consider the possibilities of the concepts that were discussed. Writing these reflections are like a fever dream cause my brain goes hyper trying to find random connections. And that is a one of the strengths of the subject. Not only am I engaged, because of the enjoyment I get out of writing and learning about new models, but it also helps me see tons of new possibilities that I could potentially use one day.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding things again this week. This is mainly because I already knew most of what was discussed. And I didn't have much of an issue understanding the idea of the snowball effect that causes the log norm distribution.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am interested logarithmic distributions or relationships appearing in nature and different things. So I will read a bit about it out of interest. But I don't need to do much to do better right now because I didn't find things too challenging.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Log normal distribution proved to be very useful because it models a lot of things in nature. Although normal distributions are also incredibly useful for modelling isolated random events. I learnt about the nature of dependent events and the kinds of distributions they often create.
