# Human Centered Complex Systems Reflection - Pinak Limaye

## Week 1
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about what a complex adaptive system is and real world examples of them. I also learnt about the differences between complex systems and other systems. Furthermore I learnt about emergence and the different system boundaries.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
Everything I learnt this week was mostly new to me. A few things such as what a system is was old information for me. This is because I have done a physics course in the past, which taught me about different systems and how we should go about defining a system for experiments. Other than that, I didn't know about what complex systems were and about the concept of emergence.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have mainly gained insights into complex systems, although the concept is still fairly confusing to me. It was initial incredibly different for me to understand complex systems because I was stuck in the idea of treating systems as a function in a program where you put in an input and get an output. And that the output or input couldn't come from within the system itself. I have now realised that a complex system can be impacted by anything within its own boundary and that thinking about complex systems in such a rigid manner does not work.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I realised that I have a very rigid way of thinking, which is a weakness in the case of this subject. However I have noticed that the strength of this subject is that it would help with modeling and dealing with scenarios which have many uncertain events.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I struggled alot with the discussion questions. Namely the one where I had to define the boundary and elements of the system. I was convinced that anything that affects the system was an input and not part of the system. But I handled it by getting a second opinion and doing some research by looking at different complex systems. I also looked at what other people were submitting as their answers.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I feel like dealt with the challenge fairly well. However next time I won't be so rigid in my way of thinking. That will make things much easier in the long run for this subject, as many things are wrought with uncertainty. So treating things as heavily defined won't work too well.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
The theory of complex systems is quite useful because it helps model uncertain scenarios so that you can predict possible outcomes. Because of this theory I have learnt how to model complex systems, but also the specific parts to look for in a system. The latter will probably be incredibly useful in my data analytics subject.



## Week 2
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about creating models of complex systems and the idea of many models. I also learnt about the wisdom hierarchy

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
The new thing I learnt this week was the many models theory. Creating models was something I learnt in data analytics and the wisdom hierarchy was something I learnt in the information systems course. However many model thinking is new. Even though I have learnt about using many data points to reduce error, I did not think about applying that knowledge to the idea of models.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insight into the many model theory. And also insights into my programming projects because I am currently looking into machine learning. I have realised that using many different concepts and using them together to help train an AI is very useful. The idea of many models made me look back at one of my previous projects where I decided to use an algorithm out of the place it was usually used. And now I realise that doing that more will lead to newer more creative solutions.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I have observed the strength of using many models to help reduce errors and come up with a new solution. Especially in programming where using different algorithms or theories can lead to new and even better solutions.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I did not have any difficult challenges this week. This is because the things we learnt this week were fairly well defined by mathematic and modelling ideologies. So I did not have to deal with misunderstandings or confusion. However one thing I did struggle a bit with was defining the system and elements in the lessons activity. However this is a carry on problem from last week, so I did the same thing as last week and compared the scenario to other scenario with a created system model and mapped it over to the new scenario.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I will look at more complex systems so that I can be better at identifying elements and relationships.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
The many model theory proved to be very useful because it helps in reducing error. It also helps with my data analytics course which requires me to build a model to predict things from chaotic data. And I feel like this theory will be incredibly useful in helping with that. I have learnt that using many models is useful in accuracy.



## Week 3
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about different behavioural models, signalling and decision trees. I also learnt about the Shapley value and the Last on the Bus model.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I now know about the shapley value, signalling and the three behavioural models (rational, behavioural, rule-based). I already knew about decision trees as I had learnt about it in data analytics. I learnt about the Last on the Bus model too, but I don't really see why I would use that model over the shapley value.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the different ways a person can think, i.e. rational, behavioural and rule-based. Knowledge of these models helps analyze different social situations or just simple decision making. I also realised that different people can be more on the rational side or on the behavioural side which makes these models about as useful as each other. Rule-based model seems the most useful to me because everyone follows a general set of rules when it comes to decision making. Things like how to act in public or treat other people is far more easily modeled by a rule-based model than it is by the other two. I have also gained insight into the shapely value and how it is used. Also the multiple examples helped me to see how I would go about fitting other scenarios into a shapley value.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I have realised the subject's strength when it comes to my data analytics course. Because things like decision trees, the shapely value and the idea of systems fits really well with my data analytics subjects. It has also been useful in making me think about my previous projects in new ways. Most notably it has made me think about my neural network again. Because I was wondering how I should distribute the error in a prediction as change accros the weights, the shapley value seems perfect for that.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding this weeks models. The only thing I am a bit confused about is how I would use Last on the Bus or signalling models.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am not sure how to improve upon my troubles this week because my troubles stem from me not fully understanding where I would use something. I think that I will eventually come across a situation where it is useful as long as I keep doing things.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Shapley value proved to be very useful because it helps out with neural networks. Although I haven't placed it in a neural network yet, it seems very useful in it. I have learnt that the Shapley value is a very useful model and that it could potentially be used in neural nets.



## Week 4
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about the System Dynamic Models, Network Models and Agent Based Models.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I didn't know about any of the models before. However System Dynamic Models are similar to Finite State Machines which I learned about in programming.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the different models I learnt this week. Network models are useful in figuring out the potential impact of an idea or habits. Agent based models look great for figuring out how people may react. Agent based models remind me of Conways Game of Life. This game is on a grid and each square follows 3 simple rules. Each square is impacted by the 9 squares around it, if too many squares around the square are lit up, the square turns off. If too few squares are lit up, the square turns off. But, if enough squares are lit up around an off square, the off square turns on. The interesting thing with this game is that you can have many complex behaviours from these simple rules. So a couple of simple rules can be used to simulate complex behaviour which is Agent Based Models.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I think that I am fairly good at making random connections between ideas. Like with connecting conways game of life to Agent Based Models or with some projects that I have done in the past. Half the time it probably isn't a proper connection, but you miss all the shots you don't take so I consider it a strength.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding this weeks models. Agent based models are interesting though and I'm interested in the way that you would come up with the rules that an Agent Based Model uses.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am interested in Agent Based Models now and will look into it. This will help me in my understanding of Agent Based Models and help me in analysing them and making rules for them in the future.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Agent Based Models seem incredibly useful. Because if you can figure out the core set of rules that people run on, you can make a very complex simulation without using too much computational power and make it very simple to understand. This isn't learning something new, but, Agent Based Models help to solidify the idea that complex things can be made from very simple components.



## Week 5
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about aggregation of action and different probability distributions. Namely the normal distribution and the log normal distribution. There was also a little bit of discussion into finite state machines.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I have learned both finite state machines and the normal distribution before in my maths and programming subjects in college. But the log normal distribution is new to me.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have mainly gained insights in to the log normal distribution and where it can be applied. I have also gained an additional insight into the network model that was discussed last week, as this distribution is often the effect of the outcome of those types of models. I have also gained additional insights into the world as a whole. Because everything seems to be connected to a logarithmic relationship in some way, either that or an exponential relationship (which is also related to log). Information theory has a logarithmic relationship, pace of life has a logarithmic relationship and so does entropy in physics and also the notes in music. I think that this is because things tend to change in an exponential manner due to things often leading to other things, causing a snowball effect. Even human perception seems to be exponential. We can easily tell if something is twice as loud as something else, but not if we add several decibals. And even stuff like the golden spiral which is found often in nature follows a logarithmic pattern.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
This subject is making me look at the world in new ways and writing these reflections always makes me blow my own mind by trying to consider the possibilities of the concepts that were discussed. Writing these reflections are like a fever dream cause my brain goes hyper trying to find random connections. And that is a one of the strengths of the subject. Not only am I engaged, because of the enjoyment I get out of writing and learning about new models, but it also helps me see tons of new possibilities that I could potentially use one day.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I didn't have much trouble understanding things again this week. This is mainly because I already knew most of what was discussed. And I didn't have much of an issue understanding the idea of the snowball effect that causes the log norm distribution.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am interested logarithmic distributions or relationships appearing in nature and different things. So I will read a bit about it out of interest. But I don't need to do much to do better right now because I didn't find things too challenging.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Log normal distribution proved to be very useful because it models a lot of things in nature. Although normal distributions are also incredibly useful for modelling isolated random events. I learnt about the nature of dependent events and the kinds of distributions they often create.



## Week 6
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about random walks, broadcast, diffusion and contagion models, markov models and granovetters riot model.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
Markov models are already familiar to me as I have worked with HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) for which I had to research what markov chains are. However random walk models and the spread models are new to me.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the random walk model and the spread model. The random walk is especially interesting to me as it builds upon my previous knowledge of markov models and adds spacial awareness to it. It also shows that despite having a greater chance for walking forward, it is far more likely for the drunk man to end up back at 0 than it appears in the governing markov chain. The contagion model is also very interesting to me as it has the possibility of losing followers. This seems far more realistic to me because eventually people get tired of the product or the idea and this could be considered as them becoming immune.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
One of the subjects greatest strengths is its ability to build upon previous things that I have seen. Like how random walks build upon my previous knowledge of markov models. It also helped me realise that you could add distance or a point system into a markov model. I never thought of doing this before.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I did not struggle much with this week. This is because I have already had previous exposure with the markov model. The granovetter riot model was also discussed earlier.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
As I did not struggle much, I do not need to consolidate most of the models covered. However, I do want to make things using the random walk model, I think that I could make a self learning model with random walk. It gives me a similar feeing to the reinforced learning model. My friend created a reinforced learning model for a car which was like a 2D random walk that changed its probablities per run. I feel like I can combine the two models in some way.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Random walk seems to be the most useful model for me. This is because I feel like it could be worked into reinforced learning. And it also helps build upon the idea of how a markov chain can work in the longterm if there was a points system attached to it. Interestingly, the only thing that you can guarantee is the minimum steps you have to take to reach 0 because there is always a chance that everything will fail, which is quite a depressing thought.



## Week 7
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about Schelling's segregation model, standing ovation model, coordination games and replicator dynamics.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
This week the new things I learnt were the Schellings segregation model, coordination games and the replicator dynamics model. 

**What insights have I gained?**  
The Schellings segregation model is very interesting to me because it shows that everyone having a small bias towards something causes a big effect. The coordination game model is also very interesting, expecially when it is connected to culture. The idea of how playing a coordination game with multiple people and trying to change your own coordination game to sync it up to other people you have interacted with, is a very nice way of expressing how culture forms and shows the grouping of different people who are close to each other. Combining the segregation model and the coordination game model creates an echo chamber effect where grouping people together with similar biases only strengthens those biases, which seperates them further. The replicator dynamics model is also very interesting because it combines both popularity and effectiveness to predict change in popularity. It takes into account how people often tend to go for what is popular despite its lack of functionality.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
The subject is very good at analysing different human interactions and social phenomena. Like the Schellings model, which explains why alot of cultures tend to clump together. It is also very good for my programming and data analytics subject because alot of ideas covered in this subject are useful in those other subjects. Many model thinking appeared in my data analytics subject this week in the form of ensemble learning methods. Ensemble learning methods use many slightly different models to take a vote on the prediction.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I found the coordination game model slightly confusing. I am struggling to understand how they are useful and I struggled a bit trying to understand why coordination models are useful to use for modelling culture. Although I understand that now, it took me quite a long time to reach that understanding. Thinking about it for a while helped me understand it.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I do not think that I did too badly this week, although I need to look further into the applications of coordination games because I still cannot think of many possibilities for the pure coordination model. This will help me to understand the implications of this model a little more.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
Schellings segregation model seems to be the most useful because the model provides an output that could be used for map creation. It creates several islands and groupings. Maybe it could also be used to create biomes for genetic algorithms. It also taught me that slight biases in a majority create big effects. This idea helps contextualise the racism issue for me, because everyone has a slight bias. And even if the slight bias is not particularly problematic in a one on one interaction. On the macro scale everyones slight bias creates a big issue.



## Week 8
**What have I learnt this week?**  
This week I learnt about Colonel Blotto's Game and the Prisoners Dilemna.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
Both of these models are new to me. Although the Prisoners Dilemna looks like the coordination game from last week.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained insights into the colonel blotto game and the prisoners dilemna model. The colonel blotto game shows the importance of playing on multiple fronts. That playing a jack of all trades playstyle is better than playing a hyper focussed playstyle. This ideology fits really well in the current day because a while back my data analytics lecturer was talking about how just knowing data analytics will get you a lot less money than knowing how to present along with knowing data analytics. The prisoners dilemna also built upon the coordination game last week because it added in the idea of thinking ahead, that playing multiple games changes the decision that the prisoners make. It also shows that forgiveness and kindness with justified punishment is the most beneficial way to play as it stops you from being exploited but also allows you to return to the norm of being kind.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
This subject randomly pops up in my head while I looking at other things. It has changed how I look at things. I played a game called Deus Ex (great game, highly recommend) recently. In the game there are three potential endings, one is an AI takes control of the population, one is complete anarchy and the third is a governing order like the illuminati. Initially I thought that the illuminati ending was the worst ending because atleast the AI grants proper decision making, while the illuminati can be flawed due to them being human. So if the lack of freedom is concerning then you should go for the anarchy ending because the illuminati restrains freedom aswell, it just keeps the control human. But when thinking about it from a systems perspective, illuminati is the best ending because a good adaptive system requires multiple parts with some kind of order. The AI has maximum order but has only a singular part, only one perspective. Anarchy on the other hand has a billion moving parts and a complete lack of order. The illuminati is a governing order of multiple people. Not so chaotic that it is hard to make use of, but not so singular that it cannot adapt. Systems thinking made me further enjoy the game I was playing and made me think about in a new way.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
I did not struggle much this week. I think the focus on just two models this week really helped solidify the idea of the model and how it works.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
As I did not struggle to much this week, I do not need to work to much harder. But the prisoners dilemna and colonel blottos game is interesting so I might look into them a bit more. It may help me come up with some more uses for these models.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
I like the idea behind Colonel Blotto, and I think that it is the most useful idea in the current day and age because it is important to have many skillsets nowadays because there are many people who have the same skills as you, but not everyone has the same set of of skills as you.



## Week 9
**What have I learnt this week?**  
I did not learn anything from human centered complex systems this week since we were doing group tasks. But I did learn a bit about e-sports last week because of the assignment. I decided to leave that stuff from last week for today because I was going to be lacking for this week on stuff to write. I will probably lack things for the next two weeks aswell, but this week I will talk about my group experience for last week since I did nothing this week.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I learnt that e-sports is a thriving market. I initially thought that e-sports would not be impacted by corona, because everything takes place online. But due to corona viewership has dropped. This is because people enjoy going to the events and the atmosphere there and that is now gone. I also learnt that league of legends esports is very popular.

**What insights have I gained?**  
I have gained some insights into league of legends esports.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I realised that I am terrible at communicating. Last week on friday, I noticed that my group member had not written his section in a proper format, nor had he related it to the things that my other group member and I had talked about earlier. Furthermore there were no solid explanations on how the models would actually be used. I should have told him that I was dissatisfied with his work. Instead I sat down and got to work trying to fix things and I said nothing. I did not do a particularly great job and I should have asked him to clarify certain bits of his work, that would probably have helped. But instead I got angry and fixed it myself.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
The challenge was explained above. I handled it poorly.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I don't know how I can improve my ability to communicate. I often struggle with speaking my mind because then the outcome would be my responsibility. The way I handled this situation was to silently make my changes to it and keep my head down so that I could blame any issues on him. I don't know why I did that and I am not sure how I can fix that. I will try to speak my mind next time.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
This one doesn't apply this week.



## Week 10
**What have I learnt this week?**  
Nothing. We did group tasks.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I did not learn anything new.

**What insights have I gained?**  
None other than realising that my group members are willing to listen to me and are friendly.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
This subject is getting me to work with people, which is something I try to do as little as possible. I am not good at working with others, so its good that this subject is making me do that. In my other subject my group member disappeared. So it is good that I can get that experience here.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
A challenge that appeared was getting my team to start designing some models, and I was able to talk with them about it. We decided that we were going to start working on designing the models and divided up the models for each of us to design something. I also helped set up git and jupyterlab on my team members desktop. The Jupyterlab setup didn't work though, I am not sure why.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I am not sure how to do better next time because I don't feel like I did anything bad this time. But I would like to know why Joyee's jupyterlab doesn't work, I can't figure it out.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
This one doesn't apply this week.



## Week 11
**What have I learnt this week?**  
I didn't work on any human centered stuff this week. I also don't plan to next week because of other assignments.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I did not learn anything new.

**What insights have I gained?**  
None.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I am terrible at focusing on getting things done. I have left almost everything till last minute and am currently in a scramble to get things done.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
The main challenge is my laziness. And I handle it terribly.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I can say that I will try not to procrastinate next time, but I say that every time and nothing changes. But for the last week and next week as well, I will be working hard to catch up on everything.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
This one doesn't apply this week.



## Week 12
**What have I learnt this week?**  
Nothing

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  
I did not learn anything new.

**What insights have I gained?**  
None.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  
I had to present and explain my machine learning model this week and the teacher said that my model was quite original. So that is a strength. But that is probably because I knew that all my other ideas were probably taken by others. So I tried running with something that seemed out there. I don't like doing things the same way as others because I feel like I hve copied and that the projects credit can no longer go to me.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**  
This week was relatively good. I managed to get a handle on everything although I did terribly in a network fundamentals project. I will try not to lag behind since the previous two weeks have been hectic. But everything is good for now, next week I will work on human centered systems stuff again. I still need to design my model.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  
I will try not to lag behind.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**  
This one doesn't apply this week.
