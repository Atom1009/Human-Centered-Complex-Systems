# Human Centered Complex Systems Reflection - Pinak Limaye

## Week 1
**What I learnt this week**
This week I learnt about what a complex adaptive system is and real world examples of them. I also learnt about the differences between complex systems and other systems. Furthermore I learnt about emergence and the different system boundaries.

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Everything I learnt this week was mostly new to me. A few things such as what a system is was old information for me. This is because I have done a physics course in the past, which taught me about different systems and how we should go about defining a system for experiments. Other than that, I didn't know about what complex systems were and about the concept of emergence.

**What insights have I gained?**
I have mainly gained insights into complex systems, although the concept is still fairly confusing to me. It was initial incredibly different for me to understand complex systems because I was stuck in the idea of treating systems as a function in a program where you put in an input and get an output. And that the output or input couldn't come from within the system itself. I have now realised that a complex system can be impacted by anything within its own boundary and that thinking about complex systems in such a rigid manner does not work.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
I realised that I have a very rigid way of thinking, which is a weakness in the case of this subject. However I have noticed that the strength of this subject is that it would help with modeling and dealing with scenarios which have many uncertain events.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**
I struggled alot with the discussion questions. Namely the one where I had to define the boundary and elements of the system. I was convinced that anything that affects the system was an input and not part of the system. But I handled it by getting a second opinion and doing some research by looking at different complex systems. I also looked at what other people were submitting as their answers.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
I feel like dealt with the challenge fairly well. However next time I won't be so rigid in my way of thinking. That will make things much easier in the long run for this subject, as many things are wrought with uncertainty. So treating things as heavily defined won't work too well.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The theory of complex systems is quite useful because it helps model uncertain scenarios so that you can predict possible outcomes. Because of this theory I have learnt how to model complex systems, but also the specific parts to look for in a system. The latter will probably be incredibly useful in my data analytics subject.


## Week 2
**What I learnt this week**
This week I learnt about creating models of complex systems and the idea of many models. I also learnt about the wisdom hierarchy

**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
The new thing I learnt this week was the many models theory. Creating models was something I learnt in data analytics and the wisdom hierarchy was something I learnt in the information systems course. However many model thinking is new. Even though I have learnt about using many data points to reduce error, I did not think about applying that knowledge to the idea of models.

**What insights have I gained?**
I have gained insight into the many model theory. And also insights into my programming projects because I am currently looking into machine learning. I have realised that using many different concepts and using them together to help train an AI is very useful. The idea of many models made me look back at one of my previous projects where I decided to use an algorithm out of the place it was usually used. And now I realise that doing that more will lead to newer more creative solutions.

**What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses or the subjects strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
I have observed the strength of using many models to help reduce errors and come up with a new solution. Especially in programming where using different algorithms or theories can lead to new and even better solutions.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I handle them?**
I did not have any difficult challenges this week. This is because the things we learnt this week were fairly well defined by mathematic and modelling ideologies. So I did not have to deal with misunderstandings or confusion. However one thing I did struggle a bit with was defining the system and elements in the lessons activity. However this is a carry on problem from last week, so I did the same thing as last week and compared the scenario to other scenario with a created system model and mapped it over to the new scenario.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
I will look at more complex systems so that I can be better at identifying elements and relationships.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The many model theory proved to be very useful because it helps in reducing error. It also helps with my data analytics course which requires me to build a model to predict things from chaotic data. And I feel like this theory will be incredibly useful in helping with that. I have learnt that using many models is useful in accuracy.
